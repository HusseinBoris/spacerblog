                                    <h3><b>Objective 1: Find out the amount of water in jupiter's atmosphere.</b></h3>
                                    <p>In February 2020, the first results (using data from the Juno mission) of the amount of water in Jupiter’s atmosphere was announced in a scientific paper published in the Nature Astronomy journal. It suggests that water makes up about 0.25% of the molecules in the atmosphere at Jupiter’s equator.  Data from the Galileo probe from 1995 had suggested that Jupiter was much drier than the Sun (it was less abundant in oxygen and hydrogen – the elements that make up water) but these results from Juno show that Jupiter has almost three times as much water as the Sun does. This is important for working out how Jupiter may have formed. The Sun was the first thing to be created in our solar system and from the disc of gas and dust surrounding it, planets began to form. Many scientists suggest Jupiter was the first planet to form accreting and pulling together material from the disc - it contains most of the gas and dust that didn’t go into forming the Sun. There are two leading theories as to how Jupiter came to be: one is that Jupiter formed pretty much where it is now and the other theory suggests it formed further out in the solar system and has since migrated in to its current location.</p>

                                    <p>If Jupiter formed at its current location from the accretion of material in the solar nebula, then only some elements would have been in a solid phase but other heavier elements like oxygen and nitrogen would have still been volatile – they would have easily evaporated and so dispersed. But if Jupiter formed further out in the colder depths of the solar system, these heavier volatile elements could freeze and therefore accrete and join together.

                                       Because water contains oxygen and the abundance of oxygen is linked to where the planet may have formed, these results could help sort this dispute.</p>

                                    <p>Jupiter is a massive planet – it contains a lot of material and the more mass there is, the stronger the gravity. Juno has an instrument that can measure the gravity field around Jupiter which gives an indication of its mass and when combined with measurements of its size this can give scientists an estimate of the density of Jupiter (how tightly packed the material in this planet is). Knowing its density can give us an idea of its composition – what it must be made of (mostly lighter elements or heavy elements). By mass, Jupiter’s atmosphere is composed of approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium with the remaining percent consisting of other elements. There are trace amounts of methane, water vapour, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds as well as carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulphide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulphur. Deeper in its interior, it contains denser materials so its composition changes slightly.</p>

                                    <p>Jupiter is marked with alternating bands of gas which are known as belts and zones – something that the astronomer Galileo observed himself over 400 years ago. The bands are cloud features along Jupiter’s jets - incredibly strong winds blowing around the entire planet at around 360 km/h. The winds in the dark coloured belts flow in one direction and the winds flow in the opposite direction in the brighter zones. Just like on Earth, clouds vary in altitude / height. On Jupiter, the cloud tops are higher in a belt than in a zone. How deep these colourful bands and other features penetrate down into the atmosphere of Jupiter is one of the key questions that scientists are looking to find the answer to.</p>

                                    <p>Juno’s Microwave Radiometer (MWR) is able to measure the atmospheric temperature at different depths by virtue of water and ammonia being good absorbers of certain wavelengths of microwave radiation. It’s the process by which our microwave ovens work – water molecules in our food absorb the energy from the microwaves, which heats the food quickly. Temperature measurements therefore give an indication of the amount of water and ammonia deep in Jupiter’s atmosphere. The MWR data has indicated that the belt near the equator penetrates all the way down (from the top of the ammonia clouds to deep within its atmosphere), while the belts and zones at other latitudes seem to evolve into other structures. The Galileo probe sent back data from depths of 120km before it stopped transmitting – at those depths, it experienced pressures of roughly 22 times the atmospheric pressure on Earth. But the sensors on Juno can measure the temperature and therefore the water content at depths where the pressure is 50 times greater than the Galileo probe experienced.</p>

At the north pole, there are eight storms encircling a single polar cyclone and in the south, five others arranged around a central storm were detected early on. But on a more recent flyby, Juno detected another which sprouted up in the south. These storms remain a mystery to scientists in terms of how they formed, why the storms remain in a stable configuration and don’t seem to interrupt each other as they rub side by side and why they don’t look the same at both poles. Over the remainder of the mission, Juno will continue to watch these storms to see if they persist or whether they disappear.</p>

                                    <p>One of the instruments on board Juno is the gravity instrument which measures the gravitational pull from Jupiter on the spacecraft as it orbits around. So if Juno feels a stronger tug while flying over one region, it can infer that there’s something more massive or a dense region below the visible clouds that it’s flying over. Now that Juno has made enough orbits around Jupiter to build a global image of it, the gravity data can be used to build up a density map of this gas giant and begin to reveal what’s hidden beneath.</p>

                                    <p>There are the two leading theories for Jupiter’s formation – that rocky debris slowly coalesced to form a solid core which then grew large enough that its gravitational pull swept up the lighter hydrogen and helium gas into a huge envelope around it and the other idea is that Jupiter was born from a dense pocket of gas that was left swirling around the Sun and it collapsed in on itself without a rocky core. Because we can’t peer right into the centre of Jupiter, its internal structure is something that has eluded scientist for decades.</p>

                                       <p>But once again Juno has made headway with this. From being sped up or slowed down by Jupiter’s gravity over different regions, scientists have been able to track the mass distribution around the planet using the gravity instrument. The data suggests that Jupiter has a core but not as expected. It’s not a compact ball at the centre with a clearly defined edge, instead it is a fuzzy diluted core which spreads across almost half of Jupiter’s 143,000 km diameter. The reason for this is still a mystery though some have proposed that it may have been struck in its early life which ended up mixing material from the core with the hydrogen-helium envelope that fills much of the rest of the planet. So Jupiter is unlikely to have a solid core but as the gas from the upper layers gets squashed and contracted in the layers beneath, the soaring temperatures and crushing pressures are likely to transform the gas into something a bit more exotic – liquid metallic hydrogen (alike to the mercury found in old thermometers). The temperature in the clouds of Jupiter is about minus 145 degrees Celsius but near the planet's centre, it’s much hotter -  it could be around 24,000 degrees Celsius  which would make it hotter than the surface of the Sun.</p>

                                    <p>The spacecraft magnetometer, which is mapping the gas giant’s great magnetic field found this striking result on its first orbit around Jupiter and now that enough data has been gathered to provide global coverage and map the planet’s magnetic field – something very strange has emerged. The magnetic field is lumpy and uneven – stronger in some place than others. The Earth’s magnetic field is produced by a dynamo. Surrounding the Earth’s solid core is an electrically conducting fluid – liquid iron. The rotation of this fluid produces our planet’s magnetic field. Our planet has two poles – the north and south magnetic poles with field lines that resemble that around a bar magnet - so it's like there's a bar magnet within the Earth. But Jupiter’s magnetic field is a bit of a mess and that’s an understatement. Imagine taking a bar magnet, bending it so it’s not completely straight, then fraying one end of it and spliting the other end in two before placing it in the planet at an obscure angle. In the north, the magnetic field lines sprout like weeds rather than from around a central point (that’s the frayed end) and then in the south  - some field lines converge and enter the planet around its south pole but some gather back into the planet in a region just south of the equator – which has now been named the Great Blue Spot (slightly confusing because it’s not a storm). The unevenness of Jupiter’s magnetic field suggests that the magnetic field may be generated closer to the surface by a dynamo action rather than from deep within, like the Earth.</p>
